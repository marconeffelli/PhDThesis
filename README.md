# PhDThesis

In this GitHub repository are stored all the datasets and programming codes employed in my PhD thesis.
The programming code is accessible upon three folders: Codes, Dataset, Figures and Tables. In all the folders, the reader can find three subfolders referring to chapter 2, 3 and 4 of the PhD thesis. Folder Codes contains the main ruotines of each chapter; folder Dataset contains the data that have been used in the thesis case studies; folders Figures and Tables contain some subruotines to derive Figures and Tables, respectively.
